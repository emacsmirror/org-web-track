@node Retrieving data
@unnumberedsec Retrieving data

When users specify which snippet of data to track on web pages or web APIs, the following methods are available:

@itemize
@item
CSS selectors, which are applied against the source code of the web page
@item
Elisp functions, which receive a DOM object or a JSON object from a web page or a web API and are expected to return a desired value from the argument
@item
Shell commands, which take a page source or an API response as STDIN and are expected to print a desired value to STDOUT
@end itemize

@node Installation

@node Defining Tracking Items
@unnumberedsec Defining Tracking Items

Before setting up each tracking item, users need to define @samp{org-web-track-selectors-alist}, which is a list of lists consisting of URL-MATCH and SELECTOR@. Each element is responsible for selecting data for the tracking item that has a URL matching against URL-MATCH and applying SELECTOR to the response. An example of @samp{org-web-track-selectors-alist} is as follows:

@findex org-web-track-selectors-alist
(setq org-web-track-selectors-alist '(("example\\.com/product" [.final-price])))

The above code means that the target value for all product items, which have a URL containing "example.com/product", can be obtained from the HTML response by searching in the tag with a class attribute of "final-price". Refer to the description of @samp{org-web-track-selectors-alist} for detailed guidance on how to define the SELECTOR@.

After appropriately defining @samp{org-web-track-selectors-alist}, users can set up each specific tracking item by calling @samp{org-web-track-setup-entry} on the desired org entry or before the first heading to create a new one in the org buffer. Users will be prompted to input the tracking URL, and then the updated value will be retrieved, stored, and displayed in the echo area according to the aforementioned settings.

@example
* Book ABC
:PROPERTIES:
:TRACK_URL: https://example.com/products/book-abc.html
:TRACK_CURRENT_VALUE: $30
:TRACK_LAST_UPDATED_TIME: [2024-07-18 Thu 16:57]
:END:
:LOGBOOK:
- Update "$30"       [2024-07-18 Thu 16:57]
:END:

@node Sending Additional HTTP Headers
@unnumberedsubsec Sending Additional HTTP Headers

In an HTTP request message, a client can include a set of information known as an HTTP header, each element presented in a key-value pair format. This allows the client to send metadata to the server for various purposes, such as authentication or user identification.

In @samp{org-web-track}, users can specify HTTP headers in a couple of ways. First, they can set a variable @samp{org-web-track-default-http-headers} that is applied to every HTTP request. Second, they can execute a command @samp{org-web-track-set-http-headers} that sets specific HTTP headers for individual entries.

@node Dealing with Dinamic Website
@unnumberedsubsec Dealing with Dinamic Website

@findex org-web-track-content-fetcher-alist
The HTTP request backend of org-web-track, either cURL or url-retrieve, lacks the ability to read a dynamic website like a JS-rendered page. To work around this issue, org-web-track employs a delegation mechanism for fetching content. CONTENT-FETCHER in the org-web-track-content-fetcher-alist is used for this purpose. Users are free to implement any procedure using libraries such as Selenium or WebDriver in it.

@node Accessing Unix Domain Socket Server
@unnumberedsubsec Accessing Unix Domain Socket Server

While org-web-track primarily focuses on the WWW server as the access target, users also have the option to connect to a Unix Domain Socket server, which provides HTTP services mainly on a local machine. A simple example of a Unix Socket server implementation complying with the org-web-track framework can be found at @uref{https://github.com/p-snow/socket-http-server}. Using this feature, non-HTTP services, such as Unix shell commands, can be effectively utilized within the org-web-track framework.

Users who want to access the Unix Domain Socket server must set the socket's path by calling org-web-track-set-unix-socket at the desired tracking item. When this feature is active, the value of the variable org-web-track-use-curl will not be respected. The cURL program will implicitly be used as the fetching backend since url-retrieve cannot access the Unix Socket Server.

@node Updating Values
@unnumberedsec Updating Values

The simplest way to update the value is to call @samp{org-web-track-update-entry} on the desired org entry. If the retrieved value is updated compared to the last value, the updated value will be stored as the TRACK_CURRENT_VALUE org property; otherwise, the entry will remain unchanged.

Alternatively, bulk updating is supported. To enable bulk updating, users must first define @samp{org-web-track-files}. This variable should be a list of files in which all tracking items, identified by having the TRACK_URL property, are selected for bulk updating. To perform bulk updating, call @samp{org-web-track-update-files}.

@node Displaying Column View
@unnumberedsec Displaying Column View

Column view in org-mode is a feature that displays properties in a table, providing a clear and comprehensive perspective. @samp{org-web-track} offers a specialized column view where updated values are juxtaposed with their previous values for tracking items. To display the column view, call @samp{org-web-track-columns} in org buffer.

If tracking items are scattered across many files, @samp{org-web-track-agenda-columns} is useful as all tracking items in the aforementioned @samp{org-web-track-files} are gathered in the agenda column view. Users can also update any item in the agenda column view by calling @samp{org-web-track-agenda-update}.

@node Creating Report
@unnumberedsec Creating Report

All updated values from the past are logged in the entry using the existing org log note feature. Log notes have a fixed format and are placed in a drawer only if @samp{org-log-into-drawer} is non-nil.

@samp{org-web-track-report} creates a table where all log note values are listed in ascending order of time, showing the transition of values over time. Users can utilize the table to create a graph using Gnuplot or analyze trends with Pandas, for example.

@end menu

@node Automatic Bulk Updating and Email Notifications
@unnumberedsec Automatic Bulk Updating and Email Notifications

While automatic updating may be ideal in certain situations, @samp{org-web-track} refrains from providing this feature directly to prevent potential data violations. However, users can enable automatic updating by calling @samp{org-web-track-update-entry} or @samp{org-web-track-update-files} from Elisp code. Below is an example implementation of automatic updates with email notifications scheduled for midnight.

@lisp
(defun exp/email-updated ()
  "Check for updates on all tracking items in `org-web-track-files'
and email me the updated list of items formatted as requested."
  (let* ((message-kill-buffer-on-exit t)
         (mail-msg (mapconcat
                    (lambda (chg)
                      (org-with-point-at chg
                        (let ((org-trust-scanner-tags t))
                          (format "%s\n\t%s\n"
                                  (substring-no-properties
                                   (org-get-heading t t t t))
                                  (org-web-track-current-changes nil "%p => %c" " | ")))))
                    (org-web-track-update-files))))
    (unless (string-blank-p mail-msg)
      ;; SMTP settings are required in advance (see smtpmail-xxx vaiables)
      (message-mail user-mail-address "Web Tracking Notification")
      (message-goto-body)
      (insert mail-msg)
      (message-send-and-exit))))

@menu
* Network Certificate Issue::
@end menu

@node Network Certificate Issue
@unnumberedsec Network Certificate Issue

Non-interactive invocation for org-web-track-update-entry may fail due to an unverified network certificate. This issue can occur when accessing a website that offers an unverified certificate, and the variable network-security-level is set to 'medium' or higher. To address the issue, accept the certificate by calling the org-web-track-update-entry command interactively up-front.
